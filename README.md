It is used for static website page

here is some tips for you to get used to github

1. the cited words

```C
    void main
    {
        printf("hello,world.");
    }
```

```
    if (isAwesome){
      return true
    }
```

After i grow up, i found myself is too simple too naive,for this amazing world wairing for me to explore.

3.i wanna take a list for what i am going to do in this evening 
  * dinner of a hotpot
  * continue with your left code
  * take a note before you sleep
  
4.and cited somewords from somewhere.
    不管全世界的所有人怎么说，我都认为自己的感受才是正确的。无论别人怎么看，我绝不打乱自己的节奏，喜欢的事自然可以坚持，不喜欢怎么也长久不了。
     No matter how other people round the world say, i do consider only what my feeling is is correct.
     No matter how they thought about me , i do not interrupt my inner rhyme, naturally consisting to love of mine, the other would not be long.
